This is the readme for Unauthenicated Stored Cross-site scripting XSS.
I used WordPress 4.2 to achieve this vunerability but it affects any version before that.

Here is my gif: 
![](Unathenticated_comment_xss)

In order to recreate this, you can use any account that has access to comment on the main page. I'll post the link to the code
that I pulled in order to recreate this.

Here is the proof of concept available at that link:
<a title='x onmouseover=alert(unescape(/hello%20world/.source)) style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;height:5000px  AAAAAAAAAAAA...[64 kb]..AAA'></a>

You'll have to modify this code a bit by adding atleast 128kb of A's and when you post the comment it should pop up hello world!
If you are having trouble recreating look at my gif and it will show the code I used.
