This is the readme for file_large_xxs.gif. The vunerability is called Authenticated Store Cross-site scripting via Image filename.

I used version 4.2 of Wordpress but it affects any version before that.

Here is my gif: 
![](file_large_xxs)

In order to recreate this, you'll have to have a large enough image file (20mb+). I went to a nasa site and grabbed an image there.

Here is the proof of concept available at that link:

Name your file this. "cengizhansahinsumofpwn<img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>.jpg", In windows it gave me some issues
with having the character "<" so I had to switch over to kali linux for me to name it. MAKE SURE YOU PUT QUOTES SURROUNDING THE
FILE NAME IN LINUX or it will not work (like presented above). Once you name it this, you can use the admin priviledge and go to
http://wpdistillery.vm/wp-admin/media-new.php. This is where you will upload the file image and it should pop up the alert.

If you have any issues, follow my gif.
