This is the readme for authenticated_xss.gif. It is called Authenticated Store Cross-site scripting XSS.

I used version 4.2 of Wordpress but it affects any version before that.

Here is my gif: 
![](authenticated_xxs)

In order to recreate this, you'll have to have an account with atleast contributor access to recreate this. So you would have
to login as admin and create a user with atleast those priviledges. Here is the link I used to recreate this.

Here is the proof of concept available at that link:

<a href="[caption code=">]</a><a title=" onmouseover=alert('test')  ">link</a>

Use this code and create a new post. Tab over to the text tab instead of visual and post this inside there. Name the page
whatever you would like to and post it and it should pop up the test alert when the link is clicked. 
If you have any issues follow the gif I created.
